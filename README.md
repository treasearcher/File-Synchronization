# File-Synchronization

This repository contains a Windows application for synchronizing multiple duplicates of a folder. If an output folder is selected, the last version of all files will be exported to the selected folder, otherwise all duplicates will be updated by them.

When Windows hosts admit others to access their duplicates of the folder by Windows file sharing functions, this app tend to be able to synchronize files in distributed systems.

Methods to share files in Windows 10 are linked below<sup>[1][2]</sup>.
